## Title

Kitty Life!

## Website Description

Our website is designed for cat enthusiasts like us to enjoy a nice and sweet time with
cute and cuddly cats. This website’s premise is simply about taking care of cats and making
sure they grow healthy akin to taking care of an actual real life cat. Players can choose to
take care of the default cats we’ve provided by clicking the feed and shower icon or collect
coins (of which you can get by taking care of the cat you have) to use in the shop. These
coins allow players to buy boxes to have a chance at getting new cat breeds or liven up the
screen by purchasing wallpapers. Cats may have differing personalities as well that would make
them respond differently to your petting so you better collect them all and have fun spending
time with these silly furballs.

If users feel lost on how to properly start the game, we’ve provided a guide page where users
can read a concise guide on how to play the game. We’ve also included accessibilities like font
size and colors that players can customize in this page to make gameplay more comfortable.

## Javascript Description
We plan to implement Javascript in our first page in which the user is able to take care of a cat. 
These will be through interactive buttons that will be for showering and feeding the cat. They also have 
corresponding bars that show how much the cat needs to eat or bathe. These bars go down every 10 minutes that 
the player is on the website.  When the cats are fed or showered, the images of the cat will change with each 
click as its hunger and shower bars rise. Along with this, the players will have the option to visit different 
shops by clicking the corresponding buttons.
