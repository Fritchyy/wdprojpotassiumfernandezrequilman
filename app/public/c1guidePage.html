    <h3> About us</h3>
    <p>Our website is designed for cat enthusiasts like us to enjoy a nice and sweet time with
cute and cuddly cats. This website’s premise is simply about taking care of cats and making
sure they grow healthy akin to taking care of an actual real life cat. There are different cat breeds
to choose from. Different cat breeds may have differing personalities as well that would make them respond 
differently to your petting so you better collect them all and have fun spending time with these silly furballs!</p>
    
    <!-- Tells the player how to play the game. -->
    <h3>Guide</h3>
    <p>Take care of the default cats we’ve provided by clicking the <b>feed, water, or bathe</b> button when the
      cat's hunger, thirst, or hygiene meter gets low. By doing so, players can earn coins. You can also
